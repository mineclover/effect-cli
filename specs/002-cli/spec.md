# Feature Specification: Sample Code Cleanup Script

**Feature Branch**: `002-cli`
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "� T��D � T�� TTX� �`  �� �l��| �� cli \�t| T��@ �  ` L ��  ��| h"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: sample code cleanup, CLI template, development workflow, script automation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of interactivity is needed - fully automated or with user confirmation?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should script also remove documentation related to examples?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: Developer wants to clean template for production use
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer receives the CLI template and wants to remove all example/sample code to start building their own CLI application with a clean codebase. They need a reliable, safe way to remove example commands, configurations, and related files without breaking the core template functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh CLI template with example commands, **When** developer runs the cleanup script, **Then** all example/sample code is removed while preserving core framework files
2. **Given** a CLI template with mixed production and example code, **When** cleanup script executes, **Then** only example code is removed and production commands remain functional
3. **Given** the cleanup script has completed, **When** developer runs tests and build commands, **Then** all operations succeed without errors related to missing example dependencies

### Edge Cases
- What happens when example code has been modified by the developer?
- How does system handle cleanup when example code is referenced by production code?
- What happens if the script is run multiple times?
- How does system handle cleanup when some example files don't exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Script MUST identify and remove all example/sample command files from the codebase
- **FR-002**: Script MUST update configuration files to remove references to deleted example commands
- **FR-003**: Script MUST preserve all core framework functionality and production command structure
- **FR-004**: Script MUST provide clear feedback about which files and configurations are being removed
- **FR-005**: Script MUST be idempotent (safe to run multiple times without side effects)
- **FR-006**: Script MUST validate that core functionality remains intact after cleanup
- **FR-007**: Script MUST rely on Git history for file recovery (no backup creation needed)
- **FR-008**: Script MUST clean up documentation by removing example-related sections from README and other docs
- **FR-009**: Script MUST show what will be deleted and require user confirmation before proceeding

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Example Command Files**: TypeScript files containing sample CLI commands that demonstrate framework patterns
- **Configuration Files**: Files that register and enable example commands in the CLI application
- **Test Files**: Test files specifically for example commands that should be removed
- **Documentation**: README sections and documentation files that reference example functionality
